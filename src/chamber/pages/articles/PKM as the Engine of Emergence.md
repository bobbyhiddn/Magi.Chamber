# PKM — Knowledge Collection as Emergence Generation

> When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.  
> For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.

> 1 Corinthians 13:11–12

At the risk of sounding heavy-handed, I’m going to make claims and arguments throughout this article. I do this for one reason that I speak of often: You have to believe what you’re studying at least a little in order to learn it, then cut the excess. I’m not going to walk softly, because I was asked to write about my method.

Knowledge unkept and unkempt is folly. Gathering knowledge as a dragon hoards his treasure, to sit on it, is useless. Our collected knowledge should serve as an engine for the generation of ideas, conclusions, and systems. Our amassed knowledge should be ordered in such a way that each piece fits into a modular system. This system should be intentionally organized towards the generation of ideas using emergent patterns, if the learning of ideas is what you aim for.

Emergence is the manifestation of systems or result of emergent systems. I settled on this definition after reading John Gribbin’s Deep Simplicity, where he explores finding order in the chaos of life.

> We are ready for the next step, and the first real insight into the emergence of life. Having stripped the study of complexity down to its bare essentials, and having found the same deep truth underpinning things as diverse as earthquakes, the stock market, and the movement of human populations, we discover that it is all built on networks, interconnections between the simple parts that make up a complex system. The importance of such networks in general and their specific importance for the emergence of life, have been investigated by Stuart Kauffman, of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico.

> Kauffman has a striking analogy that brings out both what we mean by complexity and the importance of networks in emerging complex systems. He asks us to imagine a large number of ordinary buttons, perhaps 10,000 of them, spread out across a floor. Individual buttons can be connected in pairs by thread, but at the start of the though experiment there are no such connections. This is definitely not a complicated system in the everyday use of the term. But the way you connect the buttons turns it into a complex system. You start with just the buttons on the ground and a supply of thread, but with no button connected to any other button. Choose a pair of buttons at random and tie them together with a single thread, and if you happen to choose a button that is already connected to another button, don’t worry about it; just use the thread to connect it to another button as well. After you have done this a few times, there will be a small amount of structure in the collection of buttons. Increasingly, you will find that from time to time you do indeed choose a button that is already connected to another button; sometimes, you will even choose a button that already has two connections, and you will link it to yet a third component of what has become a growing network of connections.

> The way to tell how interesting this network has become is to pick up a few buttons, one at a time, and count the number of connections they each have with other buttons. Each connected cluster of buttons is an example of what is known as a component in a network; the buttons are examples of nodes, points that connections are connected to. The number of buttons in the largest cluster(the size of the largest component) is a measure of how complex the system has become. The size of the largest cluster grows slowly at first, more or less in a linear fashion as the number of threads connecting pairs of buttons is increased; because most buttons don’t have many connections, already there is only a small chance that each new connection will add another button or two to the largest cluster. But when the number of threads approaches and then exceeds half the number of buttons, the size of the largest cluster increases extremely rapidly (essentially exponentially) as each new thread is added, because with most of the buttons now in clusters, there is a good chance that each new connection will link one smaller cluster (not just individual button) to the existing largest cluster. Very quickly, a single supercluster forms, a network in which the great majority of the buttons are linked in one component. Then the growth rate tails off, as adding more threads usually just increases the connections between buttons that are already connected and only occasionally ties in one of the few remaining outsiders to the supercluster. Although the network has stopped changing very much as new connections are made, it is by now, without doubt, a complex system.

> In the network, complexity has emerged naturally from a very simple system just by adding more connections, with the interesting activity associated with the changeover occurring all at once, right at the phase transition, where the system is switching from one state to another as a result of a very few final connections being made.

My Obsidian Graph

For those of us familiar with using the graph feature of Obsidian, this might start ringing some bells. By using Obsidian, you are demonstrating Kauffman’s experiment of emergent complexity through connection. The desire of our research is to perform a phase transition in our knowledge from scattered parts to a new, valuable, emergent product. Similar to the sorites paradox, we add grains of sand to our pile until they become a heap. Here is the definition from _Logic — A Complete Introduction_ by Siu-Fan Lee:

> _The sorites paradox is also called the paradox of the heap. It is a paradox about vagueness. It runs as follows:_

> _One grain of sand does not form a heap. Adding one grain still does not make a heap. Indeed, intuitively no one grain of sand is responsible for changing the status of the existing sum into something completely different. However, if someone keeps repeating the process of adding one grain of sand at a time over and over again, then eventually a heap will be formed. So, when does the heap come into being and what is the boundary between a heap and not a heap?_

The paradox is that something is expected to appear from repeated insignificant acts. It seems the alleged definition of insanity might also be the definition of emergence: Doing something over and over again and expecting different results.

I’ll speak later on why we want less of a heap and more of a table. I think most of those who value knowledge management have heard of, in passing or in fullness, the note-taking method known as Zettelkasten, or slip box method. This article is not another rehash of how to take different kinds of notes and place them in a specific order. Mr. Niklas Luhmann did an excellent job of that already, and the product of that method, atomic notes, is another superb framework for thinking through the intentional process of note keeping.

This is not the writing of someone who studied for a decade and came to a conclusion based on the intake of every piece of information in the field. This is what works for Micah Longmire, or, myself. I am a professional who has built his career out of documentation and well reported knowledge, and, more specifically, the application of that knowledge. Over the past few years, I have gone on a journey into PKM, and when I found something I found particularly apt or interesting regarding the space around the value of knowledge management, I would post it to the Obsidian subreddit.

This is the expounding on something I found interesting and posted. This is the emergence of a product from the combination of observation, inquisition, and collective conclusion. I was asked to go into detail on my method of knowledge management. That is what I will attempt, less from a step-by-step angle, and more of a philosophical take on why we should collect, value, and construct knowledge. With that in mind, feedback would be appreciated.

If I read an article, book, or other such source, and I find valuable knowledge in that resource, I should have a place to store it so that it is easily retrievable in the future. Ideally, there should also be a way to simulate happenstance, to spur on generative coincidence. You will not remember everything, so we must find ways to remind ourselves with minimal effort.

> “You and I are such leaky vessels that none but God can ever fill us; and when we are filled none but God can keep us full.”

> - Charles Spurgeon

So, being leaky vessels, we must write. Knowledge management is a powerful tool in the hands of rabbit hole chasers.

While I feel it is necessary for context, this section felt self-indulgent, like the introduction to an online recipe, so feel free to skip it. It was mainly so I could walk down memory road a bit and give context to why I think the way I do. The important section starts with “The Beginning of Knowledge Management, Get Knowledge”.

I want to lead off with an introduction of who I am as a Christian, former journalist, soldier, technician, and current software engineer and nerd. In doing so, I want to show how experience snowballed using the advantages and lessons I learned from each of those positions. I think this would be one of the best examples of emergence I could demonstrate.

I was raised in a firmly Christian, wholly Mississippian household with a proud reformed theologian as a father. This led to a surface level understanding of systematic logic from a young age that grew as I did. After my prodigal stage, I continued down the path of my father, and I pursued a greater understanding of God and my relationship with Him. I believe the strongest consequence of this is my fundamental lack of a belief in coincidence. I walk expectantly that the next path will emerge unexpectedly.

Much like many young men, I found myself purposeless around 20. After dropping out of college, all I had to my name was a motorcycle and a few sets of clothes. I began work under my uncle as an IT technician for around 6 months before shipping off to basic training in order to join the National Guard as a video journalist. During my time there, I became Israel. What I mean to say is that I broke my hip. I was running hill sprints at 4 am and overexerted my body. When I tell you I’ve never felt a pain in every step like a fractured hip, I mean it. I spent a month on crutches, and when I was told that I would have two chances to pass a physical training test before having to start over after three months, I rightly freaked out. I brought one book to basic training, and it was a Bible, so once again, like many young men before me, in my anxiety I opened it up to a random page and found this passage:

> If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.  
> Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?  
> For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.  
> For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.  
> Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,  
> and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed.

> Hebrews 12:8–13

This was the call to arms I needed. I began to pay close attention to my posture, to my form, to my weakness. I moved with a purpose in order that my bones might set properly. I had gone to the trial purposeless, but with a broken hip, as Jacob had, I found a blessing. I managed to scrape through my test and continue to the more mental piece of training in AIT at the Defense Information School(DINFOS). This is where I got my first tattoo and learned to play guitar, a much more enjoyable 6 months as my hip healed, and I learned writing, photography, and videography.

I returned to Mississippi a soldier with a skill set, and I am still proud of that achievement. I managed to lease an apartment with a member of my new unit and found hard times waiting there. Flooding became a monthly endeavor in those 6 hellish months. Most of my larger belongings were lost to that first floor residence as the waters burst in while we slept. I learned after the second time never to keep precious items on the floor and to keep a plethora of towels on hand. After the third flood, I learned never to expect for things to change if you didn’t fight for it. It was my first rental, so I had no idea how to stand my ground against a corporation. The fourth was my breaking point. I had to leave. I moved around many times for the next two years, never really planting roots.

I’ll fast forward a few years to avoid any unnecessary angst from my early twenties. What I learned during that time was that computers were profitable if I could apply myself, how to build a product under pressure, and how to steel my mind to mental difficulty.

I took the combination of three year’s time, effort, and a security clearance to get my first real job on a service desk in Melbourne, FL in 2018. During that time I got to experience the professional world for the first time, because let me tell you, you won’t find it in the military. I had another threeyears left in the Mississippi Guard, so I had to make the trek back and forth 28 hours once a month while I lived there. For two years I toiled at that desk and received little commendation, but as I would still consider it my formative years, it doesn’t bother me. One thing that grounded me was the knowledge I would not have survived this move without my experiences from the military and local IT. Unbeknownst to me, I was building my credentials and feats. At the time it felt like trying my best and failing on occasion. I started to carve a place in my career out of technical writing, an understanding of people, and rubber mallet brute force solutions. The former from my journalism, the communication a combination of Christianity and interview skills, and the latter the result of mental fortitude and blunt truth. From this period of my life, I gained the beginnings of a technical knowledge and my foot in the door.

Let me say, the greatest skill any IT professional can have is that of search engine analysis. I think this has everything to do with the concepts we’ll talk about shortly, because the modern search engine might be the perfect example of a syntopic emergence tool. I googled my way through every problem I encountered from the start of this role until I started to grow skills of my own. One thing I came to realize is that skills in the technical world are just well documented solutions. When you solve a problem, if you haven’t recorded what you learned, you will have to relearn your solution multiple times over again. So I learned a process of iterative searching, documenting solutions, review of previous solutions, and repeat.

About two years into my service desk job, I decided to make a list of goals for the next five years:

1. Go back to school so I can   
2. Get a better paying job so I can   
3. Find a wife so we can  
4. Move to the mountains.

Three months after I made that list, I heard of an opportunity in Utah, and upon being told that I wouldn’t receive any career elevation until I finished college, I figured that was my sign to get a move on. I picked up a desktop technician role in Ogden, UT. Here is a picture from my backyard:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*2Z5AQDV9wIUBN70Bp_kGrg.jpeg)

So, the list started out backwards. I found myself surrounded by the beauty of the Wasatch, and I thought I still had a ways to go before my career would take off. God thought differently, and in the words of the Christian rapper Shai Linne, He “chooses the least likely” options.

I spent a year in that role with the goal of trying to go to school in order to grow. Long story short, that didn’t happen. Instead, I got a job as a system administrator and within my first week, a familiar horror swept over my next few months. Our entire data center flooded. I had no part in the error and had been hired to perform minor administration efforts as a junior admin, but I was a member of the team now, so I was going to put my back into helping them get back on their feet. This is why in my resume, I list “disaster recovery” as a major skill. I had barely heard of, let alone worked with virtual machines up to that point, but I quickly became “the guy” that would backup, recover, and create vm’s on the daily. My senior admins were so busy dealing with the significant infrastructure rebuilds that I was left with what was essentially a blank slate of a program. This is both good and bad. Due to the lack of available heads, I was placed in charge of the virtual desktop infrastructure. I was able to stack feats quickly, but my stress levels were killing me. Lest I forget to mention, a week after the disaster, I fell off a wall bouldering and broke all the ligaments in my left foot. It was probably the hardest trial by fire I’ve ever experienced, and I went to basic training. Even if it wasn’t a physical trial, the brain strain finalized a solid firmament of mental fortitude. After two months of all day, overnight shifts and weekend work, I still seemed to have a lot of work ahead of me. In despair, my reversed list continued, and I met the love of my life, Aubrie Leigh.

I won’t bore you with the details, except to say she is the only reason I was able to endure past that point. She came alongside me and found any area where I was struggling and supported me, be it crisis, consequence, or COVID. My entire family caught the disease at the same time 3 weeks into our relationship, and my Danish valkyrie came and cooked soup for us when we could barely move. This woman saved my life in many ways, and she still does today. After a three-month dating period, we were engaged, and after six months of that, she became Mrs. Longmire, the greatest gift I will ever receive.

I spent six months in that system admin role before I met my next manager who subsequently hired me because I was “the only one who could follow an order”. I’ll credit that to my time in the military. This led to my introduction to the system engineering world, and it’s where my strength in systematic thinking was proven. I think I can thank this role most for my current job, because through it, I’m able to say that I saved the company 300k worth of expenses. We had a consultation with a contractor that said they wouldn’t budge from their architecture fees, so I stepped up and said let me build the documentation.

This is where my love of concise, accurate, and thoughtful documentation began. A man named Carl Stalhood took it upon himself to become the name for VDI technical writing, and I will always salute to this man for my success. I won’t sit on that for too long, but props where props are due. I followed that same manager to his next role as a Devops Engineer six months into my System Engineer role, and that’s where my love of scripting and development began. I started to build little tools for API interaction and scripts to automate the retrieval and distribution of npm packages. Little projects at the time, but I took good notes.

Even today, those little projects have proven useful, which is why you should never scrap your work. Even if no one else uses your solution, keep the work for the logical nuggets that exist within it. Since then, I have picked up another role in a larger DevOps position. I owe this position to a new found value of study, knowledge, and the growth that comes with it.

## The Beginning of Knowledge Management: Get Knowledge

> The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.

> - Proverbs 4:7

My journey into personal knowledge management began here. I wanted to find a tool that would allow for the portability of knowledge, the long-term storage of ideas, and the ability to do it in an aesthetically pleasing way. A large motivating factor in my choice would be the separation of the product from the tool. The notes needed to be their own artifact, not a component of the tool. I started with Logseq, as it used markdown files, but after about a month, I switched to Obsidian due to their more advanced community plugin scene. So far, I’ve been about it for around 10 months, and I will never go back to a place without generation through reflection. I’ve found that a systematic approach is necessary, and as a systems engineer, I enjoy that about it.

One result of this is that I started to notice I didn’t have much to write about or document, though I knew I had forgotten plenty. I think I wrote two shabby short form essays and three hair brain ideas before I realized I needed to be able to pull from more sources. I remembered back to my time in training for journalism and their advice on writing pieces. If you think about it, an interview is just a way to get the substance for your thesis. You find what you want to write about, and then you find people who know what they’re talking about. Your piece meets both in the middle by wrapping your thoughts around their facts and views. A knowledge article uses the same principles. You packetize your thoughts on a subject with found facts, this solidifies it.

This is where I slightly differ from the traditional Zettelkasten method of note-craft. Zettelkasten suggests that in order to learn from a written topic, you should paraphrase it into your own words, not copy it down. I think this is more due to the original restraint of writing your notes on an index card, therefore you couldn’t get the information verbatim unless your handwriting allowed for it. Most proponents of the system attribute it to a better manner of learning, and I think there is value in it. However, as a journalist, paraphrasing is taboo unless the differences to the original material are pointed out explicitly. If we do not capture the content we are drawing inspiration from directly, we risk not accurately portraying the author’s intent, and we end up with a pile of our own thoughts with little proof. Good journalism is to report the fact of the matter, the sources, and then say why it matters, your thoughts.

A prominent phrase from the protestant reformation was *Ad Fontis*, or “To The Sources”. The Reformation began in part because the materials used by the catholic church of the time had been paraphrased to the point of missing the narrative entirely, so the founders of the Protestant church returned to the original manuscripts and languages to find out for themselves what was true. In the same way they came to the conclusion that truth could not be found reliably in secondhand accounts of the source, we must avoid paraphrase if we want our knowledge to ring true.

The need for knowledge led me to starting to read more than I have in a long time, especially non-fiction. I’ve always been a rabid consumer of fiction, but when it came to the real world, there seemed to be a dullness. My view changed when I started to understand facts and truths as treasure in a world where quantity is placed over quality and small talk is abundant. If you stay in the same pools as everyone else, there’s nothing much to talk about. Books and other written materials allow you to be an explorer, a purveyor of hidden archives untouched. A book found and finished can add a brick to a new idea’s foundation, even if only one or two thoughts from 300 pages are kept. Those two thoughts were worth saving, because they produced at least one fresh idea in your mind. A new idea is a gift given by authors and wordsmiths, even if it was not their intention to give it. I’ll go into this more later, but this is emergence.

So I started to find ways to pitch any valuable information found into my vault and then review it at a later date. My method of choice is a tool called Readwise. There are other ways to go about it, but Readwise makes it very convenient. I won’t harp on this too much apart from saying that I think a way to review your notes at random is absolutely necessary in order to keep information fresh. If you can find a way to bring things to the front that you won’t think about often on your own, you will find yourself thanking past you for their efforts. A phrase used often in regard to PKM is that we should read as a hiker collecting interesting things along the path for review. I think this is partially correct, but it doesn’t fully hit on the vital nature of the task. This gets back into the value of knowledge, so I‘ll expose myself as the nerd, and I want you to picture yourself in a dungeon for a moment.

Midjourney — A Sigiled Cavern

You enter the ruin in a semi-prepared state with a goal in mind. You notice the features of the walls, strange scripts etched in languages you can interpret and some you cannot. An atmosphere fills the place and leaves you with a feeling of what you’ll find in its depths. You walk, stumble, crawl, and run where appropriate until you stumble on a door. You might have even missed a few along the way, but this door stood out to you, something about it resonated in your senses. You open the door and peer into the room behind it to find a pile of rocks, but amid the rocks are what seem to be precious stones and ores.

How do you know the value of the stones?   
How many do you grab?   
What will you do once you’ve gathered your fill of finds?

You can only know the value of what you find based on the knowledge you have going in. You can only gather knowledge by trying to find it. To get knowledge, get knowledge.

You grab all you can carry in your pack. Your capacity for knowledge is what determines your overall knowledge base. Steal it, grab hold of it, get knowledge.

You will treasure it in ways you cannot imagine. Stones can be thrown, placed, or sold. Knowledge can be used, built upon, and earn. There is no value apart from knowledge of value. There is no treasure apart from knowledge of the treasure. Otherwise, every stone is just a stone. From there, build things from the materials you’ve found. Get knowledge.

In the case of personal knowledge, you never know when a quote will come in handy, so you have to use your best judgement on what should be kept. You don’t want to grab every word of every book you come across, because then none of the stones are precious, they are just stones. You are both the explorer and the evaluator. So now we have to figure out how to see the dungeon from above and throughout simultaneously.

## Syntopic Reading — The View from Orbit

> Test everything; hold fast what is good.

> - 1 Thessalonians 5:21

There’s a saying in the military regarding the ranks of army officers and their symbols. I may get the species of the trees wrong, and any of the commissioned may correct me.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*RenWd5da8JzvmB3bxd0aZQ.png)

- The 2nd Lieutenant represents the modest birch, who stands among the rest of the forest and provides cover for the denizens.   
- The 1st Lieutenant is the elm tree, peering over the birch to serve as a safe middle ground for the nests of birds in their fold.   
- The Captain represents a group of trees, the spirit of their collective presence, able to account for all that goes on within them.  
- The Major is the maple higher still than the birch and elm, approaching the canopy, able to see the goings on of those below, while still serving as a member of the forest.   
- The Lieutenant Colonel is the mighty Oak, towering above all the trees, king of their forest. They can see all that goes on in their wood, and all look up to them as an example.   
- The Colonel is the Eagle, above the forest entirely and the surrounding countryside as well. They can see beyond the view of the trees and above even the mountains in order to find the most profitable hunting grounds.   
- The Generals (Brigadier, Major, Lieutenant, General) are all represented by the stars themselves, for they can see the whole earth in its glory in order to make the most knowledgeable decisions.

I say this to relate it to the four levels of reading as listed by Mortimer J Adler and Charles Von Doren’s book, How to Read a Book, another required reading of PKM. They are as follows:

1. Elementary Reading — Comprehending words from symbols. Abecedarian reading.  
 — “What does the sentence say?”  
2. Inspectional Reading — Comprehending meaning without seeing all the information. Reading within a limited time in order to understand concepts. Passage level.  
 — “What is the book about?”  
3. Analytical Reading — Comprehending content given all information within and all time to read.   
 — “What conclusions should I draw from this book?”   
4. Syntopical Reading — Comprehending a book based on the reading of other books. This can result in conclusions that might not be stated in any of the books. This can lead to emergence.  
 — “What does this book add to my understanding?”

Syntopical reading is to elementary reading what the general is to the lieutenant. You have to be able to broaden your horizon to see implications in your studies. If reading a book is to see a passages like walking through a maze, you must adjust yourself to look down at the passage as well as straight ahead. To see a book as God sees time, both as it happens and above it. An ascended perspective can help you see how the treasure you find in one room might be the key for another.

You can see this in professionals with varied backgrounds, as their experiences, though seemingly unrelated, have led them to a deeper understanding of their profession. Here is a great scene from a show I’m sure we’re all familiar with to illustrate this point:

Syntopical reading is to take the principles of concepts and to see where they rhyme with other concepts. When we read a resource, we are using our understanding to sift it for valuable information. We are saying to ourselves, “this sounds like something I’ve heard before”, “this could be useful later”, “this might have to do with that”. When those moments in reading arise, I grab that information like the philosopher’s stone and place it in my vault. You have no idea how many times I’ve had Readwise or another one of my methods of review show me a note I took months earlier and a lightbulb has gone off in my head. It’s honestly astounding how valuable an offhandedly but intentionally preserved note can be.

This goes into the magic of applied knowledge: Flow.

## Flow — Practiced Skill in Motion

> Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.  
> Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.  
> So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.  
> But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.

> - 1 Corinthians 9:24–28

The definition of luck is this: The intersection of preparation and opportunity. Flow is similar: Where practice of skill meets execution. Reading and study are a skill. The gathering and use of knowledge are a skill. They don’t just happen, they are practiced. Those who have practiced a skill are familiar in concept or in name with flow. It is a term originated by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in his work that goes simply enough by _Flow._ For the athlete, it is the execution of their sport of choice and in a moment of unconscious glory, they beat their personal record in a moment where it feels like they are in sync with their whole existence. For the musician, it is the flow of fingers, the movement of breath, the careful use of embouchure, all unthinking in how they are executed as the musician listens to themself. The programmer experiences flow in their crafting of logic and algorithm in the building of a clean and precise automation over a span of hours that passes in minutes. A quote from the renowned carpenter Mark Ellison’s _Building_ comes to mind:

> I often don’t have a ready solution for problems of this magnitude… I generally give myself a week or two to empty my head of ideas and mull.

> I’m hard-pressed to explain how it happens, but over time, by carrying around a problem with me everywhere I go, not really thinking too directly on it, an answer will usually come to me. Sometimes it’s a good one.

Midjourney — A Craftsman’s Foundry

Is this talent or magic? Both? Yes and No. This is the practice of systems. Our bodies have the capability to execute when loaded with enough experience in any skill, hobby, or profession. The point is to work your body and brain like a muscle breaking fibers in order to grow into the breakage to build support. The more you do something systematically, the less mental energy it takes to do it better. You begin to learn how to allow your body to follow the system. This isn’t immediate. This isn’t easy. It is the most magical thing we can do in this world because even magic takes practice.

In the execution of knowledge management for the purpose of idea generation, the practice is in the beating of your head against a passage until you start to see stars. You can’t beat your head on it too quickly or you’ll miss the door to the pebble pile, but the damage must be done. Get annoyed, get frustrated, but do it anyways. This is called discipline, and it isn’t fun, but it gets things done.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*gdDNS1pgj79jpL6Z5WaX1g.jpeg)

Systems are necessary for development of skill, but we must remember that even the best of systems produce unexpected effects. We can spend the intentional time practicing a skill over and over, and we can find ourselves going from one bad habit to another in different ways. Here is a passage from one of my favorite books on conceptual computer science by Daniel Hillis, The Pattern on the Stone, regarding unexpected problems when combining the pieces of a system:

> The problem goes beyond the failure of individual components. In a complicated system, even correctly functioning parts can produce unexpected behaviors when they interact. Often when a large software system malfunctions, the programmers responsible for each of the parts can convincingly argue that each of their respective subroutines is doing the right thing. Often they are all correct, in the sense that each subroutine is correctly implementing its own specified function. The flaw lies in the specifications of what the parts are supposed to do and how they are supposed to interact. Such specifications are difficult to write correctly without anticipating all possible interactions. Large complex systems, like computer operating systems or telephone networks, often exhibit puzzling and unanticipated behaviors even when every part is functioning as designed.

You may resonate with this passage if you haven’t yet chosen a path for knowledge management. You’re writing and writing, but no new content is arising. I want you to remember this, you are training. You are collecting ore, and one day, they will transition into a heap, ready to be thrown into the furnace for smelting into bars. This article is an example of that. Flow can only be achieved after much pain becomes blisters become callouses. Only then you notice a movement practiced over months execute unconsciously. Only then, the way you thought about a process may suddenly make more sense when you spent hours thinking fruitlessly. Only then, the concepts you are collecting and reviewing start to come together in a way that broadens your view of the world.

Here’s what makes studying fun….it’s pretty hard to study wrong. It’s almost a zero consequence game. The only thing you lose is your time if you didn’t get anything from it, but trust this, you will always gain something from study, even if it’s just the ability to read slightly faster, turn a page easier, remember more words than when you started. The fun comes when the discipline turns into autopilot. Eventually, you’ll be able to trust your body and mind to do the things you’ve trained it to, and you can enjoy that time knowing the effort you put into your skill is reaping evident rewards as you perform the skill itself. Doing is fun if you can trust that you won’t screw up. Studying is how you build a mind as a tool. Tools are not only for solving problems, but for creating things of beauty.

## Harmony — A Resonance Arisen from Resources

> Praise the LORD! For it is good to sing praises to our God; for it is pleasant, and a song of praise is fitting.

> - Psalm 147:1

To start this section, I want to pull from John Piper’s _Expository Exultation_, a book that in part is on preaching from the whole bible as opposed to a single passage, so apt in relation to syntopical reading. In this excerpt, Piper goes into what it means to be **_fitting_** as it is used in Psalm 147:1, the verse above.

> The word translated “fitting”(nawah) means “beautiful” or “lovely,” as in Song of Solomon 1:5(“I am very dark, but lovely”) and 2:14(“Your face is lovely,” cf. 4:3, 6:4). But the meaning of the word moved from mere physical beauty to moral beauty. As we might say, “That was a *beautiful* act of love and sacrifice.” And when the concept of beauty moves away from the mere physical to include the spiritual or moral dimension of reality, the meaning “fitting” becomes apparent. For what is ultimate, unseen, moral beauty except that something is just as it should be? It fits with ultimate reality.

> Hence this same word is used for what is “becoming” or “fitting” or “suitable,” as in Proverbs 17:7:

> Fine speech is not becoming(nawah) to a fool; still less is false speech to a prince.

> Fine speech may be beautiful in some people, but in the mouth of a fool it is out of place, unfitting, unsuitable, bizarre.

Next Piper talks about the beauty of convergent performance, and I’ll link the two together shortly:

> …unified corporate worship among diverse human beings brings into being a God-glorifying beauty that does not exist in individual worship alone. We know this because of the analogies we are familiar with in ordinary life — music, sport, military, etc. In music, there is a kind of beauty that rises from four-part harmony among singers that is different in the unified symphony of instruments that is different from the beauty of the solo virtuoso.   
>   
> Therefore, when human beings with diverse ethnicities, backgrounds, tastes, expectations, desires, priorities, peeves, admirations, and needs join their hearts and minds and voices and actions in unified worship of the one true God through Jesus Christ, a reality has come in the the world that is beautifully fitting — it befits the power and the worth of God, whose glory can win such humble, self-forgetting praises from a diverse people.

To bring this back to our train of thought, I want to think about the sand heap from the sorites paradox again. While our goal is to bring disparate things together in the effort of arising new form from the mass, I don’t think anyone wants to end up with a pile of sand, unless perhaps you were trying to form filler as a foundation for a home. But then again, we know a house built on sand doesn’t stand very long. Like the chorus resounding in harmony, we need our knowledge to resonate.

Instead, we’ll attempt to answer the age-old question of “When does a table become a table?” I would say when its parts fit rightly into a complete product. In the description of the sorites paradox, they call it a ”paradox about vagueness”. I think this is accurate, because the transition point between many grains of sand and heap of sand is as vague as can be. With our notes, we want not to form grains of sand, but bars of ore. We’ll use Piper’s definition of “fitting” in that the pieces you work with should be complete unto themselves, but capable of slotting into place to make other complete products, like a trained voice in four-part harmony, each voice complete in its own way. Our gathered knowledge should be organized in such a way that we can feel the ready resonance, waiting for its next opportunity to form a link, to be a new beauty. To take from _How to Read a Book_ again, on the way to our product, we should feel a sense of latent discovery:

> The skillful inspectional reader does more than classify a book in his mental card catalogue, and achieve a superficial knowledge of its contents. He also discovers, in the very short time it takes him to inspect it, whether the book says something important about his subject or not. He may not yet know what that something is precisely — that discovery will probably have to wait for another reading. But he has learned one of two things. Either the book is one to which he must return for light, or it is one that, no matter how enjoyable or informative, contains no enlightenment and therefore does not have to be read again.”

We gather the knowledge that feels useful to our pursuit of subjects. We hear something in the books we gather that ring of relation between each other. This feeling is what we chase, because it might help us to understand why we read in the first place: understanding.

If we read 10 books each for their own topic without listening for harmony between each other, we are lead along in 10 different directions. This is why Doren and Adler draw a significant difference between analytic reading and syntopical reading:

> In syntopical reading, as we have noted, the books that are read serve you, not the other way around. In this sense, syntopical reading is the most active reading you can do. Analytical reading is also active, of course. But when you read a book analytically, you put yourself in a relation to it of disciple to master. When you read syntopically, you must be the master of the situation. Because this is so, you must go about the business of coming to terms with your authors in a somewhat different way than before.

In analytical reading, we allow ourselves to be directed by the author through the topic they have exposited, but in syntopical reading, we conduct all 10 authors in such a way that a new melody arises from their efforts. We place each piece in its place so that the product emerges.

Midjourney — Collectively Beautiful Table

Once we understand that new ideas can emerge from previous work unrelated to our current topic of study, it frees us to see more of the world as valuable. A book is not thousands of parallel lines, all running in the same direction but never intersecting, but a felled tree entering a carpenter’s workshop, an orchestra hesitant in rest, ore in the forge waiting for a smith. To borrow again from Piper, who was himself inspired by Doren and Adler, in order to bring this kind of harmonic assembly into being, we must not string pearls, but forge chains:

> The most fruitful discovery I made about how to read was that the authors of Scripture argue. They develop arguments — trains of interlinking thoughts that lead somewhere. Until those days, I read the Bible mainly to collect precious nuggets. Doctrinal nuggets. Devotional nuggets. Pearls. These were wonderful. I don’t begrudge the years of collecting and stringing pearls. They served me well. I loved them. I think they probably would have led me faithfully to heaven. But within a matter of days, in a hermeneutics course based on the book of Philippians, I was startled to see that Paul does not string nuggets; he forges chains.

> This meant, for me, a whole new approach to Bible reading. No longer did I just read and memorize verses — collect nuggets. I also sought to understand and memorize and apply arguments. This involved finding the main point of each literary unit and then seeing how each proposition fit together to unfold and support the main point.

So when we read our “fontis”, we should collect our precious stones and valuable ores from the pebble room, but we should not expect they’ll pick themselves off the floor and into the furnace. We should practice the process of collective craft. We should be makers, not just collectors. Our product is refined, multimodal knowledge.

# Emergence  —  Daily Toil in Fruitful Soil for Intentional Growth

> And he said, “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground.  
> He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how.  
> The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.  
> But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”

> - Mark 4:26–29

So let’s rerun the definition:

Emergence is the manifestation of systems or result of emergent systems.

Where does that leave us? We’ve got a handful of collected quotes, a collection of thoughts, and a ring in our ears like the beginning of a song. Emergence isn’t complete until the table is set, and we need to build it. This will take intentionality, effort, and most of all, a desire to finish what we start.

Most people think they know what they know, but the only way to prove our efforts is to record them. This is valuable not only for the discovery of new ideas but also the refutation of false ideas. Until you can review your thoughts, you are an echo chamber. You’ll continue to have a revolving sense of what you want to say, but without pinning it to the canvas, you’ll never see it for what it actually is. In the case of false ideas, this takes exposing it to other truths, and in the case of new ideas, the collected truths are what they are made of.

Emergence is the ceiling of your current curiosity and the floor of your next. Curiosity is the fuel and ignition of emergence. Discovery is a motivator and a reward. Realization is the cement between the bricks. Emergence is the barrier and product, the ceiling of the last curiosity and floor of the next.

Midjourney — Blocks as Beautiful as the Building

Let’s finish by talking about why we’re here. I was asked for how my method works, and I’ll stop philosophizing around the issue. The end goal is practical knowledge acquisition, retention, and creation. The last quote I’ll pull from my vault will be Daniel Hillis again, a pioneer of the parallel computer, the basis of modern cloud computing. As I am a titled devops engineer and an aspiring software engineer, I think through these three “principles of the nature of computers” often, and so, they impact how I build my knowledge:

> A few general themes underlie an exposition of the nature of computers: the first is the principle of functional abstraction, which leads to the aforementioned hierarchy of causes and effects. The structure of the computer is an example of the application of this principle — over and over again, at many levels. Computers are understandable because you can focus on what is happening at one level of the hierarchy without worrying about the details of what goes on at the lower levels. Functional abstraction is what decouples the ideas from the technology.

The collection and distillation of knowledge is functional abstraction. It is to take all that you read on a subject from many sources, some of which say the same things, and to take what is common, compress it down to its first principles and whatever else it takes to call upon it easily. The knowledge you capture in their raw form are the details, and the piece you create is the abstracted representation of the collected knowledge.

> The second unifying theme is the principle of the *universal computer* — the idea that there is really only one kind of computer, or more precisely, that all kinds of computers are alike in what they can and cannot do. As near as we can tell, any computing device, whether it’s built of transistors, sticks and strings, or neurons, can be simulated by a universal computer. This is a remarkable hypothesis: as I will explain, it suggests that making a computer think like a brain is just a matter of programming it correctly.

Turing’s goal was the replication of the brain. We get to use daily what inspired his whole life and lineage. We take our inherent, innate computation and apply it to the collection, use, and generation of knowledge.

> The third theme in this book, which won’t be fully addressed until the last chapter, is in some sense the antithesis of the first. There may be an entirely new way of designing and programming computers — a way not based on the standard methods of engineering. This would be exciting, because the way we normally design computers lead ultimately to a certain fragility and inefficiency. This weakness has nothing to do with any fundamental limitations of information-processing machines — it’s a limitation of the hierarchical method of design. But what if instead we were to use a design process analogous to biological evolution — that is, a process in which the behaviors of the system *emerge* from the accumulation of many simple interactions, without any “top-down” control?

Finally, we allow the process that has brought about every invention ever known to flourish and try to do it on purpose. How do we do so? By letting our intentional bringing together of concepts and the flow of thought work together by the practice of thought-smithing. Trust the process of reading, contribute to the world through writing, and finally, form a foundation of thought. That foundation will allow you to build on it more effectively, but first it has to be laid. 

Just as you scrape, claw, and gather knowledge into your vault through striving effort, you must then place it in its setting in a fitting manner. Carve the outline one pull at a time. Pour the mold. Whatever process ensures completion. This is not pointless, this is not just fun, it is how you craft a worldview. While truth may dictate how reality abides, our view of it is cloudy and the cleaning of your lens is Sisyphean. Get rolling.

No one can tell you where to start with your pursuits, but facts build on each other towards a conclusion. The end result of collection for emergence should be emergent product. If you don’t distill what you’ve learned into a product, you’re only harming yourself. What we write is more real than our thoughts if only because it exists in reality, so the efforts taken to manifest them will reap reward. 

All of this to say, a system is necessary. My system can be described as intentional collecting and crafting of knowledge for the sake of emergent knowledge generation. If that sounds like a few other processes, that’s because every person’s process is an amalgamation of what they know. All systems are the product of intentionally gathered knowledge. If it helps one person with their pursuit of understanding, I’ll be overjoyed. If it doesn’t, it helped me, and that is the point of all of my pieces: To form a floor for my next curiosity.

> I etch a pattern of geometric shapes onto a stone. To the uninitiated, the shapes look mysterious and complex, but I know that when arranged correctly, they will give the stone a special power, enabling it to respond to incantations in a language no human being has ever spoken. I will ask the stone questions in this language, and it will answer by showing me a vision: a world created by my spell, a world imagined within the pattern on the stone.

> The computer is not just an advanced calculator or camera or paintbrush; rather, it is a device that accelerates and extends our processes of thought. It is an imagination machine, which starts with the ideas we put into it and takes them farther than we ever could have taken them on our own.

> - Pattern on the Stone, Daniel Hillis
