Whispering Creation — Midjourney

# A Thesis — Potential Futures

The subject of today’s article is a familiar one in today’s technological ecosystem. Where is the world headed now that a web app is writing essays? How long until we’re all replaced by this strange system that generates works of creativity in 10 seconds that would take us at least 10 minutes? I’ve put a lot of thought into it, and scripture has helped me come to an optimistic conclusion. Artificial intelligence will increase the potency of man’s creative power.

# The Holiness of God — The Divine Fiat

The late Dr. R.C. Sproul, founder of Ligonier Ministries, was a theological master and professor of truth. He left behind a legacy of literature that continues to impact Christians in their pursuit of a better knowledge of the divine. His faith echoes in the pulpits of reformed congregations worldwide. One of my favorite pieces by this great preacher is a book titled “The Holiness of God.” The goal of this work is to identify and espouse on the nature of the holy, or the “other”-ness of God and His sovereignty. I have read it numerous times now, mainly because, as Spurgeon says, I am a “leaky vessel”. The reason I keep coming back to it is the truth that shines through every page, and the fact that repetition is truly the key to learning.

On my most recent reread, the first chapter leapt out at me in particular. Here, he describes a concept known as “**fiat**,” a latin word meaning “creation command” that God spoke into the nothing in order to make everything.

> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.

**_Genesis 1:3_**

This made me stop and reflect on the most recent innovations in generative artificial intelligence.

Here is an excerpt from the book that I’ll use as a basis for my conclusion's afterword:

> God created the world from nothing. Once there was nothing, then suddenly, by the command of God, there was a universe. Again we ask, How did He do it? The only hint the Bible gives is that God called the universe into being. Augustine called that act the “divine imperative” or the “divine fiat.” We all know that an imperative is a command. So is a fiat. When Augustine spoke of a fiat, he was not thinking of a little Italian car. The dictionary defines fiat as a command or an act of the will that creates something.
> 
> At the present moment, I am writing this book on a computer manufactured by IBM. It is an amazing piece of machinery, quite complicated in all its parts. The machine is designed to respond to certain commands. If I make a mistake while I am typing on the keyboard, I do not have to reach for an eraser. To correct my errors, I merely punch in a command, and the computer corrects it. The computer works by fiat. But the power of my fiat is limited. The only fiats that work are the ones that are already programmed into the computer. I would love simply to be able to say to the computer, “Write this whole book for me, please, while I go out and play golf.” My machine can’t do that. I can yell at the screen with the strongest imperative I know: “Write that book!” but the thing is too obstinate to comply.
> 
> God’s fiats are not so limited. He can create by the sheer force of His divine command. He can bring something out of nothing, life out of death. He can do these things by the sound of His voice. The first sound uttered in the universe was the voice of God commanding, “Let there be!” It is improper to say that this was the first sound “in” the universe because until the sound was made there was no universe for it to be in. God shouted into a void. Perhaps it was a kind of primal scream directed at the empty darkness.
> 
> The command created its own molecules to carry the sound waves of God’s voice farther and farther into space. Yet sound waves would take too long. The speed of this imperative exceeded the speed of light. As soon as the words left the Creator’s mouth, things began to happen. Where His voice reverberated, stars appeared, glowing in unspeakable brilliance in tempo with the songs of angels. The force of divine energy splattered against the sky like a kaleidoscope of color hurled from the palette of a powerful artist. Comets crisscrossed the sky with flashing tails like Fourth of July skyrockets. The act of creation was the first event in history. It was also the most dazzling. The Supreme Architect gazed at His complex blueprint and shouted commands for the boundaries of the world to be set. He spoke, and the seas were shut behind doors, and the clouds were filled with dew. He bound the Pleiades and buckled the belt of Orion. He spoke again, and the earth began to fill with orchards in full bloom. Blossoms burst forth like springtime in Mississippi. The lavender hues of plum trees danced with the brilliance of azaleas and forsythia. God spoke once more, and the waters teemed with living things. The snail sneaked beneath the shadowy form of the stingray, while the great marlin broke the surface of the water to promenade on the waves with his tail. Again He spoke, and the roar of the lion and the bleating of sheep were heard. Four-footed animals, eight-legged spiders, and winged insects appeared. And God said, “That’s good.” Then God stooped to earth and carefully fashioned a piece of clay. He lifted it gently to His lips and breathed into it. The clay began to move. It began to think. It began to feel. It began to worship. It was alive and stamped with the image of its Creator.
> 
> Consider the raising of Lazarus from the dead. How did Jesus do it? He did not enter the tomb where the rotting corpse of Lazarus was laid out; He did not have to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. He stood outside the tomb, at a distance, and cried with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come forth!” Blood began to flow through the veins of Lazarus, and brain waves started to pulsate. In a burst of life Lazarus quit his grave and walked out. That is fiat creation, the power of the divine imperative.

The concepts that struck me were the idea of “Fiat” as a force of creation and the universe being akin to a computer. To take a quote from Neal Stephenson out of context:

> “In the beginning was the command line.”

**_Neal Stephenson — Turing’s Cathedral — George Dyson — Page XV_**

While Neal was describing what lead to the modern computer, I find it interesting that we see a similar structure going on in Genesis 1:3. God gave the first fiat to a waiting universe, which parsed the command in order to work alongside God in creation. It would seem God created the parser and shell beforehand, or that it was generated simultaneously with creation as a sub-process itself. Either way, creation resulted from command, and I believe this is vastly important when understanding not only the first sentence of the Bible, but creativity itself. God gave the command, the universe carried out the act without a need for further prompting. This is what Sproul comments on when criticizing the human fiat. He also makes a comment, and I’m paraphrasing, that the result of a fiat is the triggering of process in order to complete the imperative. In God’s case, the sub-processes are handled automatically, “The command created its own molecules”. In our case, we follow the same order of process: will, command, create.

Sproul’s criticism seems to be that man’s fiat cannot trigger these acts of process generation and completion autonomously from the commander to computation in the same way God can generate creation. Even if our creative capacity is limited to our own hands, we are still creatures who desire to make. Look around at human civilization, and you will see men who said, “Let there be” towards things as “simple” as the structure of a dwelling place, to the computer Sproul was frustrated towards. We as humans will things into being every day. Our process is just longer and more sweat-inducing.

# A Centurion’s Faith — The Mundane Fiat

I’d like to talk for a moment about authority as defined by a Roman centurion:

> 1. After he had finished all his sayings in the hearing of the people, he entered Capernaum.  
> 2. Now a centurion had a servant who was sick and at the point of death, who was highly valued by him.  
> 3. When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, asking him to come and heal his servant.  
> 4. And when they came to Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy to have you do this for him,  
> 5. for he loves our nation, and he is the one who built us our synagogue.”  
> 6. And Jesus went with them. When he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy to have you come under my roof.  
> 7. Therefore, I did not presume to come to you. But say the word, and let my servant be healed.  
> 8. For I too am a man set under authority, with soldiers under me: and I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”  
> 9. When Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning to the crowd that followed him, said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.”  
> 10. And when those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant well.

**_Luke 7:1–10_**

In a sermon by Sproul on this chapter, he again speaks of Augustine’s fiat as he recalls the words of his college philosophy professor:

I began writing this article before I found this video, and when I saw that I was onto something in Luke 7, I was overjoyed.

> The Lord God Almighty created the whole universe ex nihilo, out of nothing. He didn’t just shape and form some pre-existent matter, but out of nothing, He creates the entire universe.  
> And how does He do it? The professor says it’s through what he called the divine fiat. “Fiat,” I thought, was a little Italian car. Instead, it was the imperative form of the verb “to be.” He said God called the universe into being by the power of His voice, giving a divine imperative, saying, “Let there be light.” And the lights came on.

In the mirrored passage of Matthew 8, Jesus uses the word **“ginomai”**, which is the Greek equivalent of the Latin fiat, and the etymological origin of the word **“generate”**, when he says “let it be”.

> And to the centurion Jesus said, “Go; let it be done for you as you have believed.” And the servant was healed at that very moment.

**_Matthew 8:13_**

What the centurion is describing when he says “go”, “come”, “do this” is the same fiat that God utilized in creation, Jesus even acknowledged this in His marveling, but the centurion recognized the mundane nature of his own power. He is unable to heal his servant in the same way, so he seeks out the One whose fiat is able. Those in positions of authority have much experience in utilizing fiat. Their input is no command line, however, but other men’s wallets. The centurion himself was a man of creation, as the Jews pronounced that he had built the synagogue of Capernaum. Did the centurion place the cornerstone or have a hand in the laying of the foundation? A ruler has no need to perform the acts of which he designs and desires, but he says to do, and those under his charge perform the detailed processes necessary in order to complete those imperatives. This is the “absolute power” which “corrupts absolutely”. It is addicting to be able to see what you say come to be without the effort of your own energies.

A Generative Temple — Midjourney

A ruler can look at a servant and say, “Write this book,” and so his fiat is multiplied by the skill of the author. So, man’s fiat is charged with some form of authority, but only when employed on other men. The issue there is the reliance on the abilities and willingness of man. God has no reliance, as His fiat is followed by responses from the systems He crafted. Man cannot rely on his own fiat as a force in itself to create. This might, in a way, be changing soon, and Sproul had his finger on the reason why…

I would like to explore the idea that engineering is the act of increasing the potency of man’s fiat. Artificial intelligence is the latest iteration in the innovative process, but through emerging patterns, we might arrive at a “pseudo ex nihilo” unseen until this point. Magic will follow shortly after.

Now we must seek to be the kind of creators Christ would marvel at, drawing on the intersection of technology, creativity, and the divine.

# Expanding Human Fiat

Every man is a tool in the hand of his master. We acquire skills so that we might be employed and utilized in the realization of another’s ideas. We are cogs in someone else’s machine. This isn’t a bad thing, as without skilled individuals, nothing could be created in this world.

I’d like to posit two types of technicians employed by rulers:

- **The Engineer** — A subject-matter expert who has learned a set of skills in order to employ them in a profession. He carries out the requests of his employer to the best of his knowledge and ability.

- **The Architect** — A skilled creator who utilizes the skills of other technicians in order to realize his vision. Sometimes an architect can do both.

Technicians are the parsers of the commands of those with the ability to compensate their efforts. Engineers take in the desires and designs of our employers and find the best way to bring them into reality. For architects, they do the same, but they utilize other technicians in their vision fulfillment for the finished product. I believe they are much closer to the vein of the new reality of work than your average engineer. Soon, engineers may also have the ability to delegate the process of creation through virtual technicians. From there, AI could also utilize specialized generative models in order to accomplish tasks with the specificity needed. This is already happening in the case of AutoGPT and Jarvis. What I’m saying is that the foundation of labor might be lowered another layer.

Artificial Cooperation — Midjourney

I think it’s a shame that Sproul wasn’t able to see the current state of technology before his death, but I’m sure he’s chuckling to himself on the other side.

For those that have been experimenting with the AI craze, including ChatGPT, we know that we are much closer to being able to look at our computer and say, “Write this book.” I started this article with only a rough outline and asked it to produce me a rough draft. Sproul uses this as an example of how our ability to create is severely limited, but I think with the introduction of AI, we are steadily approaching a world where every man’s fiat is increased dramatically. We will never be able to create “ex nihilo” or “out of nothing”, but if the creation is in the virtual world, it will be fairly close. Text to image technologies like Midjourney and DALL-E are already being utilized as you can see in the images of this article, but text to structure technologies are already here and growing in the form of [Point-E](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openai/point-e). With the advancement of 3D printing technology, who’s to say that creative enablement won’t extend into reality? Or really, how soon it will? What we need to understand is that this isn’t a new concept.

To illustrate this point, I give you a scene from Community:

The Room Temperature Room

The air-conditioning engineers were given a fiat, “Keep me cool.” From there, the ruler’s part became to wait for the completion by the engineers. In the same way, the centurion told his servants, “do it,” and they figured out the details. Mr. Goodman made a good point in the skit however, if an engineer can diminish their own efforts in the execution of their employer’s will, they become rulers themselves in a way. Engineering is the ability of creators to improve on the potency of their creativity, not only to reduce the efforts taken to create a result, but to increase the efficacy in which they achieve it.

As technology advances, it brings us closer to completing Sproul’s hypothetically “impossible” request. This is not only a convenience to those who create, but an empowerment to those who are subject to other men’s fiat. We now have the ability to cause and achieve without the burden of toil, just as they do.

“Write an article based on this outline.”

That was clearly a playful exaggeration, but, artificial intelligence, like GPT, offers text generation capabilities that echo of a ruler commanding a building to be based on his blueprints.

# AI as a Partner in Human Creation

Artificial Intelligence, like the universe parsing God’s commands, can help fulfill human desires and ambitions in an almost magical sense. The natural language barrier is being shattered as we speak, and the founders of the modern computer knew that would be one of the final lines to cross before we could achieve full human-machine communication:

> Men naturally speak redundant languages organized around unitary objects and coherent actions and employing 20 to 60 elementary symbols. Computers “naturally” speak nonredundant languages, usually with only two elementary symbols and no inherent appreciation either of unitary objects or of coherent actions.
> 
> To be rigorously correct, those characterizations would have to include many qualifiers. Nevertheless, the picture of dissimilarity (and therefore potential supplementation) that they present is essentially valid. Computing machines can do readily, well, and rapidly many things that are difficult or impossible for man, and men can do readily and well, though not rapidly, many things that are difficult or impossible for computers. That suggests that a symbiotic cooperation, if successful in integrating the positive characteristics of men and computers, would be of great value. The difference in speed and in language, of course, pose difficulties that must be overcome.

**_Man-Computer Symbiosis — Dr. J.C.R. Licklider — Director of ARPA, Creators of the Initial Internet_**

AI can serve as a partner in creation, working alongside humans to achieve their visions and bring new ideas to life in a way that could not be accomplished by the layman until now. Ask anyone who has taught themselves how to code in the past 6 months. Every man has been given the ability to say, “Go,” “Come,” and “Do this,” and our computers are close to, if not succeeding in, miraculously accomplishing the tasks we are setting them to do.

The craziest part is that we are only 4 months into this new era. All of us can see the writing on the wall. The primary thing I am trying to say is a re-iteration on a common phrase these days:

> “No one is getting replaced by AI. Everyone is being replaced by another person who can utilize it.”

**_Anonymous_**

While the current state of AI can be frightening, and caution is always advised, make sure to keep the future’s possibilities in mind. It could be brighter than you imagine, and, as the Vice-Dean put it, you could find yourself in a much “cooler” place because of it.
